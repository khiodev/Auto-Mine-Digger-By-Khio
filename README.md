# Auto Mine Digger (By Khio)
Simple automatic mine digger for club penguin private servers like newcp, cplegacy, etc
It's really easy to use simply open the AutoMineDigger.py then when you get to the mine in-game you have to mark 6 positions you're penguin/player will then choose one of the positions you give it and move there. To mark these positions in the first place press 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 to mark the positions then press 'Q' on you're keyboard to toggle on/off the program. Have Fun And Enjoy ðŸ˜€!!!
